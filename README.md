# Semantic-Shape-Recognition

## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting various shapes and assigning semantic labels to them. The system will focus on four specific shapes: triangle, circle, square, and star. By leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system will analyze input images and identify the presence of these shapes accurately.

The project involves several key components:

* Shape Detection: The system will employ image processing algorithms to detect and localize shapes within the input images. Techniques such as edge detection, contour analysis, and geometric feature extraction will be utilized to identify regions corresponding to the target shapes.

* Semantic Labeling: Once the shapes are detected, the system will assign appropriate semantic labels to them. Each shape will be classified based on its distinctive characteristics, such as the number of sides, angles, and spatial arrangement of its components.

* Machine Learning Model: To enable accurate shape classification, a machine learning model will be trained using a dataset of labeled shape images. The model will learn to differentiate between different shapes and generalize its knowledge to correctly classify new instances.

* User Interface: A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow users to interact with the system. Users can input images or use a live camera feed to detect and label shapes. The interface will display the detected shapes and their corresponding labels in a visually intuitive manner.

* Performance Evaluation: The accuracy and robustness of the shape detection and semantic labeling system will be evaluated using a variety of test images. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score will be calculated to assess the system's performance.

The outcomes of this project can have several applications. It can be utilized in educational settings to teach children about different shapes and their characteristics. In industrial contexts, the system can be integrated into quality control processes to ensure proper shape conformity in manufacturing. Additionally, the system can assist in image-based search and retrieval tasks, where specific shapes need to be identified and matched.

Overall, this project aims to develop a reliable and efficient shape detection and semantic labeling system that can accurately recognize and classify triangle, circle, square, and star shapes. By combining computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system will provide valuable insights into the shapes present in images and enable meaningful semantic understanding of visual data.
